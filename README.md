# E-Commerce Product Page

Hello,
This is my second project using React. I used useState, useEffect and useRef hooks.
I also do every page from header with React Router to only learn how to use it, so every page going same component, except home -of course-.
I tried to make this project same as original design.
You can check the original design below.

You can visit my project from right side of the page, under the 'About' section.

I also use 'Ant Design' package for display the images.

I use Sass for CSS. It is my first project that i used Sass in it.

This challenge was very fun to do also very challenging. I learned a lot while doing it.
